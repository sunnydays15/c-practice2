Once upon a time, there was a beautiful forest filled with tall trees, lush green leaves, and vibrant flowers.
In this forest lived a small rabbit named Poppy.
Poppy always enjoyed hopping around and nibbling on fresh shoots. 
One day, while exploring deep into the forest, Poppy stumbled upon a stunning flower. 
It was bright red and emitted a delightful fragrance.
Instantly captivated by its beauty, Poppy decided to pluck the flower. 
However, it was situated in a high place beyond the reach of the rabbit's tiny paws. 
Poppy pondered how to obtain it.
Just then, a deer passing by overheard Poppy's dilemma and offered to help. 
The deer suggested using its large, sturdy antlers to reach the flower. 
Gratefully, Poppy accepted the deer's assistance, and together they retrieved the flower.
Poppy planted the flower in the loveliest spot in the forest, creating a special place guarded by both Poppy and the deer. 
Through this little adventure, Poppy learned that with the help of friends, any obstacle can be overcome. 
From then on, Poppy and the deer always supported each other, sharing many joyful moments in the forest.
